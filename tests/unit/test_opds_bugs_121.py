"""Regression tests for fork issue #121 — three independent OPDS bugs
reported by @droM4X on v4.0.39 against the Readest client.

1. **Log spam.** Every authenticated OPDS request emitted a WARN line
   `OPDS Login failed for user "" IP-address: ...` because OPDS clients
   commonly issue an unauthenticated probe before sending credentials.
   The empty-username probe is not a login failure — the WARN was noise.

2. **Anon+auth multiplexing.** When anonymous browsing was enabled and
   the client also sent (possibly stale) credentials, the server
   returned 401 instead of falling back to the Guest catalog. The user
   expected anon-enabled deployments to behave the same whether the
   client tried to authenticate or not.

3. **Hardcoded English on three OPDS root entries.** "Alphabetical
   Books", "Recently added Books", and "Magic Shelves" rendered in
   English on a Hungarian-locale UI while sibling entries ("Hot Books",
   "Read Books") localized correctly. The entries' titles were bare
   Python literals in a dict — pybabel-extract can't follow
   ``_(variable)`` at extract time, so those three never made it into
   ``messages.pot``. Wrapping with ``N_()`` (lazy_gettext) marks them
   for extraction.

These tests pin the fix at the source level so a refactor can't regress
any of the three.
