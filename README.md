# Calibre-Web-NextGen

> **The community-maintained build of [Calibre-Web-Automated](https://github.com/crocodilestick/Calibre-Web-Automated) (CWA).**
> Same software, same compose file, same data — with the bug fixes that have been sitting open in upstream's PR queue already merged in.

## TL;DR

If you're already running CWA, change one line and run two commands:

```yaml
services:
  calibre-web-automated:
-   image: crocodilestick/calibre-web-automated:latest
+   image: ghcr.io/new-usemame/calibre-web-nextgen:latest
```

```bash
docker compose pull && docker compose up -d
```

Library, settings, users, OAuth, KOReader sync — all carry over. Nothing to migrate.

## Why this fork

Upstream CWA is a great project. The maintainer hasn't merged a PR in months, and the queue of community-written fixes has been piling up. That's how you end up with bugs like:

- Safari users couldn't search metadata at all (silent 400 since 4.0.6)
- Cover saves from Hardcover/Google Books returning a vague "not a valid image" error
- Generate Kobo Auth Token returning a blank page
- Several admin routes that were unauthenticated and shouldn't have been

Calibre-Web-NextGen picks the safe community fixes out of upstream's backlog, ships them in regular releases, and writes fresh fixes for high-impact bugs that don't have an open PR yet. Same software, same data layout, same UI, same compose file — just actively maintained. Patches stay clean enough that upstream can pick them back up any time.

---

## What you get out of the box

Every feature CWA upstream has — plus everything upstream `:latest` is missing because review's been quiet:

- **Safari fixes**: metadata search and book delete both work again
- **Cover saves work**: Hardcover, Google Books, iTunes, Open Library covers all save and persist
- **Kobo**: bookmark sync no longer crashes on missing `Location`; auth-token IDOR (#1303) closed; "blank page on generate token" (#1328) fixed
- **Reverse proxy**: user-profile updates honor path prefix
- **Docker**: healthcheck stops tripping orchestrators on `/ → /login` 302
- **OPDS**: `.cbr` / `.cbz` use IANA mimetypes (less pickier readers)
- **Security**: 14 admin/log routes that were silently unauthenticated are now `@admin_required`; cover-enforcer shell-injection patched
- **Higher-resolution covers**: Libra Color and other high-DPI e-readers get proper-sized covers from Google Books, Amazon, and an iTunes-backed booster
- **Translations**: backlog of community translation PRs merged (ja, fr, cs, hu, zh_Hans, zh_Hant, …)
- **DNB metadata provider**: no longer hangs in synchronous cover-validation
- **Dark theme + magic-shelf ordering** plus a stack of small UX fixes

## Quick start

You need: **Docker** + **Docker Compose**. That's it.

1. Make a folder for your library:

   ```bash
   mkdir -p ~/calibre-web/{config,library,ingest}
   cd ~/calibre-web
   ```

2. Drop this `docker-compose.yml` in there:

   ```yaml
   services:
     calibre-web:
       image: ghcr.io/new-usemame/calibre-web-nextgen:latest
       container_name: calibre-web
       environment:
         - PUID=1000
         - PGID=1000
         - TZ=America/New_York   # change to your timezone
       volumes:
         - ./config:/config            # settings, user db, logs
         - ./library:/calibre-library  # your books live here
         - ./ingest:/cwa-book-ingest   # drop new books here to import
       ports:
         - 8083:8083
       restart: unless-stopped
   ```

3. Start it:

   ```bash
   docker compose up -d
   ```

4. Open `http://localhost:8083`, log in with **`admin` / `admin123`**, change the password.

Done. Drop an `.epub` into `./ingest/` and it'll show up in your library within a few seconds.

> **Tip — file ownership matters.** Files in your library and ingest folders should be owned by your user (UID 1000 by default), not `root`. If you see permission errors after restoring from backup or copying files in as root, run once: `sudo chown -R 1000:1000 ~/calibre-web`.

## Full Docker Compose setup

Here's a more complete compose file with every option commented:

```yaml
services:
  calibre-web:
    image: ghcr.io/new-usemame/calibre-web-nextgen:latest
    container_name: calibre-web
    environment:
      # Match your host user/group so files in your library
      # are writable from both the container and the host.
      - PUID=1000
      - PGID=1000

      # https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones
      - TZ=America/New_York

      # Override the in-container port if you need to.
      # If you set this below 1024, also uncomment cap_add below.
      - CWA_PORT_OVERRIDE=8083

      # Set this if your /config or /calibre-library volumes are
      # on an NFS or SMB share. See "Network shares" below for what
      # this changes.
      - NETWORK_SHARE_MODE=false

      # If you sit behind multiple proxies (e.g. Cloudflare Tunnel
      # → nginx → CWA), set this to the total proxy count so session
      # protection sees the right client IP. Default 1.
      - TRUSTED_PROXY_COUNT=1

      # Optional: Hardcover API token for the Hardcover metadata
      # provider. Free, sign up at https://hardcover.app/account/api
      # - HARDCOVER_TOKEN=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiI…

    volumes:
      # Settings, user database, logs. Empty folder for new installs;
      # for existing CWA users, point at your existing /config.
      - /path/to/config:/config

      # Your Calibre library. New install? Use an empty folder and
      # CWA will set one up. Existing user? Point at the folder
      # containing your metadata.db.
      - /path/to/library:/calibre-library

      # Drop new books in here to import them. WARNING: files in
      # this folder are DELETED after processing. Don't point this
      # at a folder you also use as long-term storage.
      - /path/to/ingest:/cwa-book-ingest

      # Optional: bind your existing Calibre plugins folder
      # - /path/to/calibre-plugins:/config/.config/calibre/plugins

    ports:
      - 8083:8083

    # Uncomment if CWA_PORT_OVERRIDE is below 1024.
    # cap_add:
    #   - NET_BIND_SERVICE

    restart: unless-stopped
```

### What goes in each volume

| Volume | What it is | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `/config` | App settings, user accounts, OAuth tokens, KOReader sync state, logs | Empty folder for new installs. Carry over from CWA verbatim. |
| `/calibre-library` | Your books + Calibre's `metadata.db` | If empty, CWA creates a fresh library. If it has multiple `metadata.db` files inside, CWA picks the largest. |
| `/cwa-book-ingest` | Drop zone for new books | **Files here are deleted after processing.** Don't park books here long-term. |

> **Don't nest the binds.** All three should be separate top-level folders. Putting `ingest` inside `library` causes weird recursive behavior and ingest loops.

---

## First run

1. **Open the UI** at `http://your-host:8083`.
2. **Log in** with `admin` / `admin123`.
3. **Change the admin password** (Profile → Account).
4. Go to **Admin → Edit Basic Configuration → Feature Configuration** and enable **Allow Uploads**. (Without this, the metadata-fetch and cover-from-URL features can't write to your library.)
5. **Drop a book** into your ingest folder. Watch it appear in the library within a few seconds.

That's it. The Admin → Settings panel has lots of optional toggles (auto-convert formats, automatic backups, EPUB fixer, KOReader sync, OAuth, etc.) — the [upstream wiki](https://github.com/crocodilestick/Calibre-Web-Automated/wiki) is the source of truth for those, since this fork doesn't change them.

---

## Migrating

### From upstream CWA

One line change. Stop the container, swap the image, start it.

```diff
- image: crocodilestick/calibre-web-automated:latest
+ image: ghcr.io/new-usemame/calibre-web-nextgen:latest
```

```bash
docker compose pull && docker compose up -d
```

Same data, same settings, same users, same OAuth tokens, same KOReader sync state. If anything breaks, swap back — the data format is identical.

### From stock Calibre-Web

1. Stop your existing Calibre-Web container.
2. In your new compose file, point `/config` at the same `/config` folder you used for Calibre-Web.
3. Whatever you bound as `/books` in Calibre-Web should be bound as `/calibre-library` here.
4. Pick an empty folder for `/cwa-book-ingest` (it's CWA-specific, no equivalent in stock CW).
5. Start the container.

All your users, settings, and shelves carry over. The first launch will take a few extra seconds while CWA registers itself with the existing app database.

---

## Common configurations

### Network shares (NFS, SMB, ZFS)

If your `/config` or `/calibre-library` volumes live on a network share, set:

```yaml
- NETWORK_SHARE_MODE=true
```

This:
- Disables SQLite WAL mode (NFS/SMB don't reliably support it → "database is locked" errors)
- Skips the recursive ownership-fix step at startup (it's slow on NFS and often fails on SMB)
- Switches the ingest watcher from inotify to polling (network-FS inotify events are unreliable)

This is tested and supported. It's a few seconds slower on ingest but otherwise behaves the same.

> **Files owned by root after copy?** This fork already chowns files back to your `PUID:PGID` after each metadata-change cycle, but if you've copied files in as root before upgrading, run once: `docker exec calibre-web chown -R abc:abc /calibre-library` (replace `abc` with your `PUID` user if you've customized).

### Reverse proxy / Cloudflare Tunnel

If you sit behind multiple proxies — e.g. **Cloudflare Tunnel → nginx → CWA** — tell CWA how many proxies are in front of it:

```yaml
- TRUSTED_PROXY_COUNT=2
```

Without this, CWA may see different client IPs across requests and trigger "Session protection" warnings, forcing re-login on every page change. Default is `1`. Set to your actual proxy depth.

### Hardcover metadata provider

[Hardcover](https://hardcover.app/) is a great free metadata provider. To enable it:

1. Sign up at https://hardcover.app and grab an API token at https://hardcover.app/account/api.
2. Add to your compose env:

   ```yaml
   - HARDCOVER_TOKEN=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiI...
   ```

   Or paste it into **Admin → Edit Basic Configuration → Hardcover API Key** in the UI.
3. Restart the container.

Now Hardcover shows up in the Fetch Metadata modal. (This fork includes a fix for "cover save shows blank/reverts on refresh" that affected stock CWA + Hardcover.)

### KOReader sync

CWA has built-in KOReader progress sync — no separate kosync server needed.

1. In KOReader, install the CWA plugin: visit `http://your-cwa:8083/kosync` for download + install instructions.
2. In KOReader, point the plugin at `http://your-cwa:8083` and log in with your CWA username + password.
3. Read on any device. Your progress syncs back to CWA, and from there to Kobo if you have Kobo sync turned on.

## Troubleshooting

### "Cover-file is not a valid image file, or could not be stored"

Was the #1 user complaint on upstream's tracker. **Fixed in v4.0.13+**.

If you're still seeing it, you probably have `root:root`-owned book directories from a pre-fix install. Run once:

```bash
docker exec calibre-web chown -R abc:abc /calibre-library
```

### "Generate Kobo Auth Token" returns a blank page

**Fixed in v4.0.14+.** Upgrade to the latest image.

### Database is locked errors / app frozen

If your library is on a network share, set `NETWORK_SHARE_MODE=true` (see [Network shares](#network-shares-nfs-smb-zfs) above). If on local disk, this usually means a previous container shutdown was unclean — restart Docker, then the container.

### Session-protection warnings, forced re-login on every nav

Set `TRUSTED_PROXY_COUNT` to match your proxy depth. See [Reverse proxy](#reverse-proxy--cloudflare-tunnel).

### Books in `/cwa-book-ingest` aren't being picked up

Three common causes:
1. **Files owned by root.** Make sure ingest files are owned by your `PUID:PGID` user.
2. **Watcher missed them.** Click the **Refresh Library** button on the navbar — it does a one-shot scan.
3. **Format isn't allowed.** Check **Admin → CWA Settings → Ingest** for your allowed formats.

### Default login isn't working

The defaults are **`admin`** / **`admin123`** (lowercase). If you've already logged in once and changed the password but forgot it, stop the container, delete `config/app.db`, and restart — this resets the database. (You'll lose all user accounts, but the library itself is untouched.)

### Something else is broken

Check the [open issues](https://github.com/new-usemame/Calibre-Web-NextGen/issues) on this fork or [open a new one](https://github.com/new-usemame/Calibre-Web-NextGen/issues/new). Include:
- Output of `docker exec calibre-web cat /app/CWA_STABLE_RELEASE` (the version you're on)
- Last 50 lines of `docker logs calibre-web 2>&1 | tail -50`
- What you did and what you expected to happen

## What's different from upstream

| | Upstream CWA `:latest` | This fork `:latest` |
|---|---|---|
| Cover saves from Hardcover/Google etc. | ❌ "Not a valid image" error | ✅ Saves and persists |
| Generate Kobo Auth Token | ❌ Blank page | ✅ Works |
| Safari metadata search | ❌ Silent 400 | ✅ Works |
| Safari book delete button | ❌ Killed by Feb-4 commit | ✅ Works |
| Kobo bookmark sync (missing Location) | ❌ Crashes | ✅ Tolerates |
| `/kobo_auth/generate_auth_token` IDOR | ❌ Open (any user can mint another user's token) | ✅ Closed |
| Reverse-proxy user-profile updates | ❌ Drops path prefix | ✅ Honors `getPath()` |
| Docker healthcheck on `/ → /login` 302 | ❌ Trips on `curl -f` | ✅ `-fsL` follows |
| `.cbr`/`.cbz` OPDS mimetypes | ❌ Non-IANA | ✅ IANA-compliant |
| Cover resolution on Libra Color etc. | ❌ Often 290×475 (Hardcover thumbnail size) | ✅ 1000×1500+ via booster |
| Admin routes (cwa_logs, convert, epub_fixer) | ❌ 14 unauthenticated | ✅ All `@admin_required` |
| Translations: ja/fr/cs/hu/zh_Hans/zh_Hant | ❌ Stuck in PRs | ✅ Merged |

Bug fixes are conservative; we don't add features upstream wouldn't accept. If a backport touches anything risky (auth, schema, deps) it gets manual review before merging.
