# Governance

## Stewardship

- **Project lead**: [@new-usemame](https://github.com/new-usemame). Final call on releases, security policy, and commit access.
- **Maintainers**: trusted contributors with commit + merge rights. Earned through ~3 quality PRs + a clean track record. Mostly merge in their own subsystems; escalate cross-cutting changes to the project lead.
- **Contributors**: anyone with a PR. Credited by handle in release notes.

## Relationship to upstream

This fork exists because review on `crocodilestick/Calibre-Web-Automated` has been paused and the PR + issue queue accumulated. The fork is a **continuation, not a takeover**. Operating principles:

- We do not own upstream. We comment on existing threads, never edit, never close.
- Every backported patch is mergeable back if upstream review resumes.
- Original PR authors are credited by handle in release notes.
- If the upstream maintainer returns and wants to coordinate, repo is public, branches are public, all squash-merge SHAs trace to upstream PR numbers in their commit messages.

## Becoming a maintainer

1. Open ~3 PRs that get merged without major rewrites.
2. Ask in an issue or DM `@new-usemame`.
3. If accepted, you get write on the repo + the `maintainer` GitHub team. No paperwork, no CLA.

If you previously had a PR ghosted on upstream and want commit access here to keep your work moving — reach out. That's exactly what this fork is for.

## Decision process

- **Bug fixes / security**: any maintainer can merge under the tier policy in `CLAUDE.md`. Security fixes follow the disclosure flow in `SECURITY.md`.
- **Features / refactors / dep changes**: project lead approval required. Open as a PR with a design note in the description (or a markdown file under `notes/`).
- **Disagreements**: discuss in the PR or an issue. If unresolved after a week, project lead decides. Decisions are reversible with new evidence.

## Succession

If `@new-usemame` is unreachable for 90 consecutive days (no commits, no responses on issues, no responses to direct contact):

1. The longest-tenured active maintainer becomes acting project lead.
2. They coordinate with other active maintainers to confirm the role within 2 weeks.
3. The fork's repo settings (admin, secrets, package permissions) get rotated — see `notes/SUCCESSION-PLAYBOOK.md` *(to be written when there's a second maintainer)*.

The fork should never go dark just because one person stops showing up. That's the whole point.

## Code of conduct

Be respectful in PRs, issues, and Discussions. No personal attacks, no harassment, no off-topic political flame wars. Disagree on the technical question, not the person. Project lead can lock or remove abusive comments and ban repeat offenders.

Specific to this fork: **no hostility toward upstream or its maintainer**. We are guests in their ecosystem. If you can't keep that tone, don't post here.

## License

Same as upstream CWA (GPL-3.0). Contributions are accepted under the same license. No CLA.
